# NimIUPDemo
is a DEMO for some to the IUP, Scintilla and CD librarie for [Nim programming language](http://nim-lang.org)    
the wrapper is incomplete    

sad, the CAIRO CANVAS fail because some of my trouble with pointer and .h convertion to Nim   

**the demo code is frightfully ugly**    

*NOTE*: this was only for learnnig Nim and Wrapper **YOU SHOULD DO TO USE IT** 

## INSTALL
#### Install IUP and CD
of course you need a recent release of Nim (> 0.10.2)
then you must to install IUP and CD on from [TechGraph]() according your OS
