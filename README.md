# NimIUPDemo
this is a DEMO for some to the IUP, Scintilla and CD librarie for [Nim programming language](http://nim-lang.org)  

UPDATED for NIM 0.20.2 (1.0 rc)    
the iup lib has been change to add some missing in iup, cd and add scintilla     
but still lack of plot     


the wrapper is incomplete an inusable     
*NOTE*: 
        this is for me to learn Nim     
        **you'd better not use it except you love risk ;-)**     
        **only test on linux mint 19**      
        **the demo code is frightfully ugly**    


*sad, the CAIRO CANVAS fail because some of my trouble with pointer and .h convertion to Nim*   


## INSTALL
#### Install IUP and CD
of course you need a recent release of Nim (> 0.10.2)
then you must to install IUP and CD on from [TechGraph]() according your OS
