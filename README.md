# NimIUPDemo
this is a DEMO for some to the IUP, Scintilla and CD librarie for [Nim programming language](http://nim-lang.org)    
the wrapper is incomplete an inusable     
*NOTE*: 
        this is for me to learn Nim     
        **you'd better not use it except you love risk**     
        **the demo code is frightfully ugly**    


*sad, the CAIRO CANVAS fail because some of my trouble with pointer and .h convertion to Nim*   


## INSTALL
#### Install IUP and CD
of course you need a recent release of Nim (> 0.10.2)
then you must to install IUP and CD on from [TechGraph]() according your OS
